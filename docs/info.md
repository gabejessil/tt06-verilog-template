## How it works

Counting timer game! 4 buttons, start, reset, p1, p2. The goal time is seen on the screen after reset, once start is selected the timer will begin at 0.0 and go to 9.9. After 3.0 seconds the display is hidden, guess the answer!

## How to test

If you select the Player button and Start button you can see the time the player selected. THis only works after both players have answered 

## External hardware

You need a PMOD 7 segment disp 1286-1065-ND, 4 button  PMOD 1286-1145-ND
